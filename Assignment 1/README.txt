/*
 * This program decodes ciphertexts using the Caesar cipher technique.
 * Left shifts are used to encode the message and right shifts are used to
 * decode the ciphertext. 
 * The ciphertext is read from a file named "ciphertext.txt" that should be
 * present in the current working directory.
 * The number of right shifts required to decode the message is calculated
 * using a (not so) secret key, the CS login of the intended recipient.
