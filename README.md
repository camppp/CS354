# CS354
Its a course that teaches introductory operating system knowledge along with some machine organization content. 
I took it with professor James. He's really nice and his lectures have clear structures. The course is very knowledge dense. 
If you wanted to get an A you need to study the notes carefully and maybe read some more textbook. 
Exams are not tough as long as you know the stuff. They don't test your IQ like 577 does.
