 * csim.c - A cache simulator that can replay traces from Valgrind
 *     and output statistics such as number of hits, misses, and
 *     evictions.  The replacement policy is LRU.
 *
 * Implementation and assumptions:
 *  1. Each load/store can cause at most one cache miss plus a possible eviction.
 *  2. Instruction loads (I) are ignored.
 *  3. Data modify (M) is treated as a load followed by a store to the same
 *  address. Hence, an M operation can result in two cache hits, or a miss and a
 *  hit plus a possible eviction.

Before running, compile your code:
    linux> make clean && make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim
